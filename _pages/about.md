I am a recent graduate of National Taiwan University with a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in robotics and computer vision. Building on my hands-on experience as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Vecow Co., where I worked on **FPGA design**, sensor integration, and real-time systems, I am now eager to pursue a second graduate program in **Electronics Engineering**. To complement my practical experience, I have completed online courses in VLSI CAD, FPGA Computing Systems, and IT Automation with Python, equipping me with a strong foundation in electronics. I am excited to continue developing my expertise and contribute to advancements in embedded systems and electronics engineering.

About me
======
My academic journey has been driven by a passion for robotics, automation, and electronics. I hold a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from National Taiwan University, where I specialized in **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), **computer vision**, **motion planning**, and **navigation for mobile robots**. My experience at Vecow Co. has deepened my skills in embedded systems, FPGA design, and real-time computing. I am excited to continue my studies and make meaningful contributions to Electronics Engineering.

In addition to my academic journey, I have gained practical experience through an internship at a drone company, where I worked on **sensor fusion** and applied advanced filtering techniques to estimate orientation, altitude, and position.
